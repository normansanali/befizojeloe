However, he is more well-known for being the child of Norwegian mountain climber Arne Naess Jr. and Diana Ross, the singer and actress of the song “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”</strong></p><p>Naess is one of the five children born to singer Diana, who has twelve number-one hit singles from her two marriages. All of his brothers and half-siblings are extremely well-known, though not as much as their singing mother Diana.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Ross8217_Net_Worth_and_How_Much_Did_Naess_Inherit_From_His_Rich_Father>What Is Ross’ Net Worth and How Much Did Naess Inherit From His Rich Father?</span></h2><p>Ross was raised by two incredibly affluent parents: his mother Diana had a net worth of about $250 million, while his father had left behind a corporate empire valued at over $500 million. But Naess’s projections of this kind haven’t been figured up or made public yet.</p><p>The issue of how much of his father’s enormous wealth he inherited is also up for debate. Despite rumors to the contrary, according to several sources, Arne’s children all profited greatly from their father’s empire and are reportedly still receiving some from his current businesses.</p><p>In addition, Ross is a rather successful businessman in his own right, having founded a nightclub in Los Angeles and a few other companies. Naess’s net worth is estimated to be in the millions of dollars, at the very least, given all of that and his social media lifestyle.</p><h2><span id=Owner_of_a_Nightclub_Ross_Naess_Also_Works>Owner of a Nightclub, Ross Naess Also Works</span></h2><p>Ross Naess, Diana’s son, was born on October 7, 1987. He used to own a barbershop and a nightclub in Hollywood. He is listed on Instagram as one of the co-founders of the Los Angeles nightclub Warwick. In addition, he was the proprietor of the Hollywood barbershop Like A Gentleman, which has since closed.</p><p>Like his father Arne Naess Jr., Ross is an avid mountain climber. Naess also works as an entertainment producer. He has worked in the film industry as well.</p><p>In 2014, Ross served as an executive producer for the documentary Acid Girls. The 34-year-old is reportedly also a co-founder of Untapped, a business that plans music festivals. In addition, he owns a restaurant called The Hideaway.</p><h2><span id=The_Parent-Child_Relationship_Between_Diana_Ross_And_Arne_Naess_Jr>The Parent-Child Relationship Between Diana Ross And Arne Naess Jr.</span></h2><p>When on vacation in the Bahamas, Naess’s parents, Diana Ross and Arne Naess Jr.—the late businessman and the Scandinavian—met. In 1985, they tied the knot.</p><p>Diana has said time and time again that her greatest love was Naess’ father. Ross, her son, once claimed that his Oscar-nominated mother often talks about him.</p><p>Diana and Arne, the parents of AD Naess, divorced in 2000. For fifteen years, they were husband and wife. Diana’s second marriage was to Arne, the father of Ross.</p><p>Robert Ellis Silberstein and the Mahogany singer were wed for the first time in 1971–1977. From his first wife, Arne also had two daughters, Katinka and Leona, and a son, Christopher.</p><h2><span id=The_Death_of_Naess8217s_Father_While_Ascending>The Death of Naess’s Father While Ascending</span></h2><p>In January 2004, Ross lost his father, Arne Naess Jr. Tragically, Arne lost his life in a climbing mishap close to Cape Town, South Africa. The adventurer/businessman from Norway was sixty-six at the time.</p><p>When Naess learned of his father’s passing, he claimed to have been in his biology class. Naess and his siblings grew close to their mother Diana after the death of the Norwegian businessman.</p><p>When Ross and his siblings were little, every summer Arne Naess would take them on vacation to Norway.</p><h2><span id=Siblings_of_Ross_Naess>Siblings of Ross Naess</span></h2><p>Naess’s brother, Evan Ross, is younger than her. During their marriage, Arne and Diana had no other children. Despite this, the ex-couple also had several children from their previous partnerships.</p><p>The siblings of Ross Arne Naess, Evan Olav Ross, Nicklas Naess, Louis Naess, Christopher Naess, Katinka Naess, and Leona Naess are his on father’s side.</p><h2><span id=Owner_of_a_nightclub_in_Los_Angeles_Ross_Naess_his_mother_and_former_lead_vocalist_Evan_Ross_from_left>Owner of a nightclub in Los Angeles Ross Naess, his mother, and former lead vocalist Evan Ross, from left</span></h2><p>Actor Evan Ross of Atlanta, singer Diana Ross of Baby Love, his mother, and older brother Ross Naess, who occasionally climbs mountains, are pictured from left to right.<br>Evan Olav, the younger brother of Ross, is an actor who appeared in the Hunger Games films. Evan, who is also an artist, is wed to Ashlee Simpsons, a singer and the vocalist of Pieces of Me.</p><p>Through Arne’s connection with fellow Norwegian businesswoman Camilla Astrup, Naess also has two younger half-brothers, Nicklas Amadeus Naess and Louis Dekke Naess, who are both mountain climbers.</p><p>Tracee Ellis Ross, an actress best known for her role as one of the stars in the ABC series Black-Ish, is one of Naess’s siblings. She was born into Diana and Robert Ellis Silberstein’s marriage.</p><p>In addition, Naess is the half-brother of Diana’s other two daughters from her romance with Silberstein, Chudney Ross and Rhonda Ross Kendrick.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Between_AD_Naess_and_His_Wife_Kimberly_How_Did_They_Get_Started>Relationship Between AD Naess and His Wife, Kimberly: How Did They Get Started?</span></h2><p>Kimberly Ryan Naess, the proprietor of a wine firm, is married to Ross Naess, who is currently 34 years old. Leif Arne and Indigo Shadow Naess are the couple’s two children together. Through a mutual friend, Ross and Kim got to know one other in the mid-2000s in Los Angeles.</p><p>Following their initial encounter, they encountered one another more times while residing in the same cities. Then one day Kim received an invitation from Ross to a gathering at his place. It was eventually after that that the couple started dating.</p><p>More specifically, Kim had invited Naess out on a date since she believed that a long-distance relationship wouldn’t work and the singer of Endless Love’s kid would be attending college in the fall of 2006. At Malibu Creek State Park, on their tenth anniversary, Ross proposed to Kim.</p><p>However, the couple was expecting their first child at the time. Naess had assured his children’s mother that he would pop the question before to the arrival of their first child.</p><p>Naess himself poured his concept onto the ring for the engagement, while Bunny Bedi’s Made In Earth was the artist responsible for its creation. It appeared that the circlet was more unusKid because it had a raw stone surrounded by black diamonds. Ross,&nbsp; son of the Special Tony Award recipient, wed Simpson in the summer of 2017.</p><h2><span id=Kim_And_Ross_Naess_Married_On_A_Beach>Kim And Ross Naess Married On A Beach</span></h2><p>Naess and Simpsons, his companion, were together for 11 years prior tobeforearriage. By the time of their nuptial celebration, they had resided in six different circleand had three dogs and a son.</p><p>Naess and Kim chose Rancho Dos Pueblos in Santa Barbara, which is close to their home in Northern California, as the location of their wedding. The area had rural ranch settings, a private beach, and wooded areas that provided shade.</p><p>Three days were spent at the wedding. The couple provided opulent tents with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean for their guests.</p><p>Their son Leif was present during the wedding, and the bride was also seven months along with their second child, Indigo. The wedding had a boho atmosphere, and Kim, the bride of Naess, wore a white and gold Maria Korovilas gown designed by the designer.</p><p>On the other hand, Ross Naess, the groom, looked dapper in a traditional black Ralph Lauren tuxedo and top hat.</p><p>The wedding of Naess and his wife Kimberly involved the entire family. Nine of Naess’s 10 siblings attended the wedding, which was performed by Ross’s mother Diana.</p><h2><span id=Other_Facts_About_Ross_Naess>Other Facts About Ross Naess</span></h2><p>It’s said that Ross is dyslexic as well.<br>When You Tell Me That You Love Me, the singer’s music video, featured Ross beside his mother Diana, the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, when Ross was younger.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Smolsprout, Martin Braithwaite, and Victoria Mercado."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":63}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/smolsprout/"}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":"https://popularbio.com/martin-braithwaite/"}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":"https://popularbio.com/victoria-mercado/"}{"1":63}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Smolsprout</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Victoria Mercado</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Mountaineer</a> <a href=# rel=tag>nightclub manager</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Yohanes Kidane Suicide Case: Missing Netflix Engineer Found Dead</a></h3>Discover the details of Yohanes Kidane's suicide and the sad situation that led up to it.
