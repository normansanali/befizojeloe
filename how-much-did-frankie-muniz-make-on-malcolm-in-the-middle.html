For every <a href=#>Friends</a>, there are <a href=#>plenty of shows that don't last long</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the 2000s, Malcolm in the Middle became a huge hit, and Frankie Muniz was the star of the show. <a href=#>He and the boys are all grown up now</a>, and they've since moved on to new phases in life. Muniz had a wonderful career, and he really cashed in on Malcolm.</p><p>Let's take a look at the actor and how he made millions.</p><h2 id=how-did-frankie-muniz-make-on-39-malcolm-in-the-middle-39>How Did Frankie Muniz Make On 'Malcolm In The Middle'?</h2><p>During the height of his career, actor Frankie Muniz was a popular face in Hollywood. He was able to find success in a number of different projects, and this made him a recognizable face around the world.</p><p>Acting was definitely his bread and butter, and while many people know him best for his time on the small screen, he actually found plenty of success in the world of film, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his successful stint in acting, Muniz would shift his focus to racing, and though he was not a force on the track, it was still amazing to see him pursuing something that he was passionate about.</p><p>Muniz did deal with some health concerns due to concussion from his racing days, and he addressed this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>.</p><p>"And everyone was telling me you’re having these TIE’s (transient ischemic attacks) or mini-strokes. Nobody could give me a straight-up answer. If you search my name, all it talks about is that I have no memory or that I’m dying of strokes. The reality is I finally got diagnosed with just aura-migraines, intense migraines."</p><p>The man has had a successful life, and it all started back on his hit series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is The Real Reason Why Frankie Muniz Stopped Racing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-malcolm-in-the-middle-39-was-a-major-hit-in-the-2000s>'Malcolm In The Middle' Was A Major Hit In The 2000s</h2><p>In January 2000, right at the start of the new millennium, Fox debuted a series called Malcolm in the Middle, and people had no idea just how great this show would end up being. Even now, so many elements of this show continue to hold up, which is a testament to both the writing and the acting.</p><p>Starring Frankie Muniz and a talented cast with performers like Bryan Cranston, Malcolm in the Middle is a great example of a sitcom that did all the little things right. Instead of having a wholesome family, this show was focused on a chaotic family who was barely scraping by, and this made for an entertaining series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For seven seasons and 151 episodes, Malcolm in the Middle was thriving on the small screen. Sure, it had the occasional lackluster episode, but overall, this show knocked it out of the park on a weekly basis. This is precisely why fans continued to tune in every step of the way.</p><p>Muniz was the star of the show, and thanks to its success, he was pulling down a ton of money at a young age.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Frankie Muniz's Career Destined For A Major Comeback?</a></span></p><h2 id=muniz-made-bank-on-the-show>Muniz Made Bank On The Show</h2><p>So, how much was Frankie Muniz making while starring on the hit series? In what should come as no surprise to fans, the actor was making millions of dollars, and this was all thanks to the massive success of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, "During the first few seasons of "Malcolm", Frankie earned a per-episode salary of $30,000. That works out to $480,000 for the first season, $750,000 for the second season and $660,000 for the third season. For the 4th, 5th and 6th seasons, he earned a reported $75,000 per episode. That's $4.95 million across those three seasons. In the final season, Frankie earned $150,000 per episode. That's $3.3 million. Total it all up and Frankie earned around $10.15 million in base salaries alone from the first run episodes of Malcolm in the Middle. With union royalty rates, he likely earned around 80% of that in the show's first syndication run"</p><p>It is incredibly remarkable to think what he was able to accomplish so early on in life, and while it was nice that he was making millions of dollars on Malcolm in the Middle, the truth is that he was also cashing in on other projects as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Frankie also earned millions from his acting career. Perhaps most-notably, he earned $2 million for the first installment of Agent Cody Banks and $5 million for the sequel," reports Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Bryan Cranston Keep In Touch With 'Malcom In The Middle's' Frankie Muniz?</a></span></p><p>Frankie Muniz had one heck of a career in Hollywood, and his net worth improved drastically thanks to his hit series.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Are ‘Malcolm in the Middle’ Stars Frankie Muniz And Justin Berfield Still Close Today?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1llqeur7fInmSmrZ6ex265wKScZqeeYrqiuMKoo6ZlmaN6tbTEZqSinJShsnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-billingsley-net-worth-67105.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Billingsley Net Worth">&larr;
