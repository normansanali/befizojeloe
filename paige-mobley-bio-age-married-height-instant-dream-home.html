Every episode starts with the customers being duped into leaving their homes for the day, at which point the remodeling crew arrives and starts the transformation.</p><p>Four professional builders who participate in the show take on the challenge of constructing dream homes for persons who have contributed significantly to their community and who still do so. The phrase “Instant Dream Home” alludes to the 12-hour time frame that contractors have to build homes.</p><p>Behind the host of Instant Dream Home is a team that is equipped to handle any kind of abode. The exhibition includes a variety of inventive ideas, such as “backyard wonderlands,” “storage solutions,” and spaces designed for infants.</p><p>She show’s synopsis read, “Hosted by Danielle Brooks, Instant Dream Home is part home renovation show and part heist movie! A group of families is in for the surprise of their lives, with their homes about to be totally transformed and radically improved from ho-hum to OMG… in just one day!”.</p><p>Paige is a native of Detroit, Birmingham who is working as a special project expert. She is the leader of all of the special projects that the team adds to the houses in order to make them unique and one-of-a-kind. The first season of Instant Dream Home&nbsp;was actually shot in the summer and early fall of 2021.</p><p>Instant Dream Home was filmed entirely in the state of Georgia. Danielle and the team of four renovators filmed all eight episodes in the greater Atlanta metropolitan area. During filming, several of the design team members shared photos from Atlanta on their respective public Instagram feeds.</p><p>Paige said the experience was “the greatest summer of [her] life,” while Danielle shared that she got a “really cool opportunity last summer” to be the host of the show.

She was a senior at Loyola Marymount where she majored in theater arts.</p><p>Furthermore, The Academy of Sacred Heart High School graduate admitted she would pretend to be sick sometimes so she could stay home from school and watch marathons of America’s Next Top Model. Eventually, she appeared on reality TV shows like America’s Next Top Model and placed 7th and became the 9th contestant to get eliminated.</p><p>“I always loved the show for the drama and excitement,” she said. “When ‘Top Model’ casting producers reached out to me in Cycle 22, I felt like this was it.

Camden recently celebrated her 31st birthday in April 2022.</p><h3><strong>Is Paige Mobley Married?</strong></h3><p>As was previously discussed, Paige Mobley preferred to keep certain aspects of her private life private.
