His zodiac sign is Sagittarius, and he is<strong> 25 years old.</strong></p><p>Henry Oweh is his father’s name, and Tania Oweh is his mother’s name. Both of his parents were born in Nigeria and later immigrated to the United States. His family is really important to him. Jayson Oweh has three siblings: Kaylen and Otega, two brothers, and Natasha, a niece. In terms of his schooling, he began at Blair Academy. He attended Pennsylvania State University after graduating from high school.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Jayson Oweh’s football career began when he was a young boy. When he started playing football for the Blair Academy team, his passion grew even more. His tactics changed as time went by.

His<strong> net worth</strong>, however, is still being assessed since the exact figures have not been revealed.</p><p>However, certainly, the situation will not be the same shortly. Similarly, being selected in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens would help him increase his net worth.</p><p>According to some outlets, the minimum salary for a newly drafted NFL player is $610,000.
