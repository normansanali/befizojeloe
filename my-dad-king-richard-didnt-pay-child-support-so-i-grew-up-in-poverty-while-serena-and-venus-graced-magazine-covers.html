There wasn’t always meals on the table. We went downhill.”</p><p>Sabrina added: “In my teens, I was always thinking about suicide, I tried it once, it was always with me, and it was about my dad, I had mental health issues.”</p><p>Over the course of their childhood, Sabrina remembers Richard turning up just once at the doorstep when she was ten and then spoke to him again at college.</p><p>“Somehow I got hold of my dad through a relative and asked for $1,000 to pay some of the college bill at Hope Christian University,” she said.</p><p>“He said he’d only give me the money as a loan.&nbsp;That’s when I knew he was an a**hole.”</p><p><strong>Read our King Richard live blog for the very latest news and updates…</strong></p><p>Sabrina added: “After college, I was done with my dad. He had never paid any child support and all he wanted to give me was a loan.”</p><p>She then began to hear about her much younger half-sisters Serena, 40, and Venus, 41, who were at that time making their mark as tennis juniors.</p><p>To save face with friends, she’d pretend they all got along.</p><p>Sabrina added: “I’d say I was still in contact with my dad, we went on vacations, but it was a lie. The unwritten law in our family: you don’t speak bad about the girls, who were then living in Compton.</p><p>“I didn’t meet Serena and Venus until I bumped into them by complete chance at Knott’s Berry Farm, a theme park in California, when they were teenagers.”</p><h2>CANCER DEATH</h2><p>Richard’s first wife Betty died of breast cancer in 1998.</p><p>Sabrina said: “She needed some medication for the cancer, and it was too expensive for her to pay for it. I reached out to my dad, but I couldn’t get hold of him.</p><p>“He had no interest whether she was dead or alive. It was utterly mind-numbing that my dad couldn’t even come to my mom’s funeral.”</p><p>She would hear from her dad every now and then, but it was after having the first of two sons – Elijah, now 21, then Solomon two years later – that their relationship completely broke down.</p><p>“My siblings called me and said that dad is at Indian Wells with the girls playing in a tournament and he wants to speak to you.</p><p>“When he called, I said: ‘What do you need, dad?’ He said: ‘I love you.’</p><p>“No you don’t, what do you want? Don’t try this love thing.</p><p>“The girls are playing here, why don’t you come down, you’ll get the good seats, see the girls, then the reporters can take the pictures.</p><p>“It was typical him, he wanted to make it a PR opportunity, but I never wanted to meet the girls for publicity or money, only in private.”</p><h2>PRAISE FOR HER SISTERS</h2><p>While her sisters have risen to sporting fame, earning colossal fortunes, Sabrina insists she is not bitter and doesn’t want money from them.</p><p>However she says it does hurt that the siblings from the Williams’ sisters’ mother Oracene Price’s first marriage – Isha and Lyndrea – are often seen on the tennis circuit and showbiz parties, yet the Williams side are always absent.</p><p><a href=#>Speaking in 2020</a> she said: “I think they’ve done fantastic, they have a lot of pressure from the black community to be role models.”</p><p>As for her father, Sabrina said: “I always made excuses for him.”</p><p>“I always believed in my heart that my dad would come back to get me. I think I was really disappointed my dad didn’t choose me,” she added.</p><p>New movie <a href=#>King Richard</a>&nbsp;shows how a man with no background in tennis and very limited financial resources, guided his daughters to unprecedented success.</p><p>It reveals the racism, violence and hardship the Williams family had to overcome.</p><p>And it details just how “complicated” of a man three times married Richard is, according to Oscar nominated actor Smith.</p><h2>‘A SPERM DONOR’</h2><p>Sabrina has already accused <a href=#>her father of being “just a sperm donor”</a>.</p><p>And she said her father was a <a href=#>serial philanderer who may have numerous secret sons and daughters</a> across the US.</p><p>“I know there’s more siblings, I was told between fifteen and nineteen all over the place, from LA to Louisiana,” she told The Sun.</p><p>“My mom always argued with my dad about his affairs, he was a serial cheat. I remember that was always the main thing they’d talk about.</p><p>“He is a selfish man, lives only for himself, he just uses his kids to get what he needs. He’s not a dad, he was just a sperm donor. He had five kids, and left them to my mom to grow up in poverty, and never once helped.”</p><p>The Sun has contacted representatives for the Williams family for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000693909193.jpg><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>We pay for your stories!</h3><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnna56pa3DZqKippdiv6qvx5qpnWWUnrGvwIypmLJlk522rbCMrKypqJ%2BnwW6%2FzmagZp%2BimsRuwc9moKdloKTDpr7TsmSwoJmhsm6%2FxKucp5ldlruledWepa6rXZy%2Foq%2FEnWSmmZeWx6q6xGaaqK6Vp8Bw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nels-abbey-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-118665-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nels Abbey Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
