Krol is best known on TikTok for his ‘soft boy aesthetic.’</strong></p><p>Benjamin Aleksander Krol, aka Benji Krol, is a 22-year-old TikToker who has gained many followers and fans over the years.</p><p>In June of 2013, Krol posted on Instagram for the first time. Since then, he has gained over 2.1 million followers on the app.</p><p>However, TikTok helped him rise to fame with over 33 million followers. The young social media personality is famous for the variety of content he uploads.</p><p>He keeps his fans entertained with funny videos, colorful makeup, and face-paint videos.</p><p>Krol is also available on YouTube, where he uploads vlogs and cooking videos with over 3.4 million subscribers.</p><p>In August 2020, Benji made headlines when he and his then-boyfriend, Jorge Garay, were accused of child grooming.</p><p>The 15-year-old victim spoke about the abuse via an anonymous Twitter account, stating that the couple would send sexual texts, nude photos, and videos of themselves.</p><p>While Benji first denied the allegations, he retracted his statement and took responsibility for his actions.</p><p>Following this incident, Benji confessed to attempting to commit suicide. It was later confirmed that he and Jorge broke up due to these allegations.</p><h2>Who Are Benji Krol Siblings? Brothers Thomas And Rowy</h2><p>Benji Krol was born on 14th December 2000. He is one of three sons of parents Andre and Alejandra Krol.</p><p>Unlike him, Benji Krol siblings, Thomas and Rowyn Krol, do not find themselves in the media limelight.</p><p>Benji prefers to keep his personal life private and has been pretty good at doing so. Due to this, not much is known about his brothers.</p><p>Nevertheless, Benji Krol siblings do make short appearances in his videos and social media posts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Benji-Krol-Siblings.jpg><p>Benji’s younger brother Rowyn Krol, who is called Rowy by his loved ones, often makes content with his brother. However, Thomas, the third Krol siblings, can rarely be seen in Krol’s content.</p><p>In September of 2022, Benji posted a video on YouTube titled ‘Turning my brother into me.’<br>As the title suggests, he attempted to make his brother look like him.</p><p>Benji shares in the video that despite being biological brothers, they look nothing alike. His younger brother, Rowyn, shares that people have pointed out their likeness.</p><p>Even though they are currently based in Madrid, Spain, Benji Krol siblings and family are originally from Brazil. Their father, Andre, is a businessman, and their mother, Alejandra, is a homemaker.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Ankita Lokhande Siblings: Sister Jyoti, Brother Arpan And Sooraj Lokhande</a></p><h2>Does Benji Krol Have A Sister?</h2><p>There are countless collaboration videos on Benji Krol’s TikTok account with TikToker Liza Anokhina. In both captions and comments, the duo claim to be siblings.</p><p>But is Liza Anokhina really one of Benji Krol siblings?</p><p>The answer is NO. Liza and Benji are not siblings. Though they may be related, there is no record of the two being biological siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Benji-and-Liza.jpg><p>Like Benji, Liza is also a social media star.

Currently, she has 5.44 thousand subscribers on the video-sharing platform.</p><p>Liza Anokhina was born in Moscow, Russia, on April 30, 2007. She has three siblings of her own; two sisters and a brother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jpucp6KZYrizu8tmqqKanJ67qL%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rickey-d-shon-collins-net-worth-60551.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rickey D'Shon Collins Net Worth">&larr;
