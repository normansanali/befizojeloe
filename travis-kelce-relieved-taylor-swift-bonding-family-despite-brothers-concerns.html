The Kelce family, while happy for Travis, couldn't help but be a little bit worried about what this sudden exposure would do to him. However, Taylor Swift's charm is apparently not just a performance, and she managed to bond with the Kelce family and put their minds at ease.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-won-over-travis-39-family-despite-his-brother-39-s-concerns>Taylor Swift Won Over Travis' Family Despite His Brother's Concerns</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/travis-kelce-and-his-mom.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are probably the hottest celebrity couple in the world right now, and NFL fans have gotten used to seeing the singer as another football fan by now. The two of them have been incredibly supportive of each other's careers, with Travis showing up for her concerts and cheering her on as much as she does him. However, there's no point in ignoring that Taylor is infinitely more famous, and therefore more exposed, than he is, so of course, it took some getting used to for him and the Kelce family.</p><p>His older brother, <a href=#>Jason Kelce, was particularly unsure about the relationship</a>. "This is another level of stardom that typically football players don’t deal with," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he pointed out, a little alarmed</a>. "It's certainly been weird, the level that it is now. On one hand, I'm happy for my brother that he seems to be in a relationship that he's excited about, that he is genuine about. But there's another end of it where it's like, 'Man, this is a lot'."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even so, the family appears to have gotten over this fear now, as Taylor was seen watching the football matches with Donna Kelce, and the two of them seemed very close.</p><h2 id=travis-kelce-is-relieved-taylor-is-bonding-with-his-family>Travis Kelce Is Relieved Taylor Is Bonding With His Family</h2><p>The couple appears to be getting more and more serious as the rumors about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's future together grow. And a big reason why they work so well together is, reportedly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how well Taylor gets along with Travis' family</a>. "Everybody knows how close Travis is with his family, so it really means everything to him how seamlessly Taylor blends in with all of them," a source shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, everyone was pleasantly surprised by how "humble" and "down to earth" she is, despite her insane level of fame, and she fits in effortlessly with their family. "It's almost like she's known his family forever, and he loves that about her."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-s-most-memorable-off-script-moments-so-far-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)">The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' has been memorable for many reasons, but not everything has gone according to plan...</p><p>This is great news, since everything points out to the couple getting ready to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take their relationship to the next level</a>. "Taylor and Travis are doing really well. They try to spend as much time as they can together. Travis also makes it a point to make sure Taylor feels as comfortable as possible at his home.
