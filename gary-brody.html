After playing tennis with Gary, she uploaded a picture and wrote,</p><p>“What is the root of the word Tennis Love?”</p><p>Also, Gary and Jill were bound by their passion for tennis. Almost every day, they played tennis at the time. The couple was first seen at Wimbledon together in the summer of 2018 before they went officially. After the match, Jill also left some flirty comments on her latest Instagram photo date. Some fans seemed surprised to say that it was just six months after her husband died and she was still dating. If you don’t know, in January 2018, Jill lost her husband, Bobby Zarin, to Cancer. She was married twice, Bobby in 2000 and her first husband, Steven Shapiro, in 1987. The death of her ex-husband was also the primary reason why Jill fell in love with Gary. She shared that Gary was there for her in a tough time. Besides, Jill was persuaded that even her ex-husband, Bobby, would have “approved” him. Apart from that, Jill shared that one day she could see her own marriage to Brody. In her own terms,</p><p>“We’re going to get married at the right time. We haven’t been engaged yet.”</p><p>And when it came time for the wedding, Jill insisted on making sure it was a “simple” bash. Contradicting her claims, “Screenrant.com” said that Gary was Jill’s fiancee at the time. As of 2020, Gary and Jill were living together at Gary’s penthouse; previously owned by the painter Georgia O’Keefe.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bert McCracken- Bio, Height, Net Worth, Wife</a></h3>Bert McCracken is a well-known American singer and composer.
