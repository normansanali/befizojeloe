But there's no question that the vast majority of them are just at the cusp of their stardom. This includes Haley Lu Richardson, who has <a href=#>co-starred in a number of high-profile projects with A-list celebrities</a> and <a href=#>scene-stealer Simon Tabasco (AKA Lucia)</a>. Creator Mike White has a knack for finding recognizable actors and making them absolute sensations. This includes Canadian actor Adam DiMarco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DiMarco adds unbelievable charisma and heart to his character, Albie Di Grasso. But while Albie is undeniably likable, there's no doubt he frustrates some viewers. Mostly because he constantly does the wrong thing when it comes to dating. Or, more specifically, winning the heart of Haley Lu Richardson's Portia.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with GQ</a>, Adam DiMarco explained that while he has a lot in common with his character, he also sees where he falls short in the love department...</p><h2 id=who-has-adam-dimarco-dated>Who Has Adam DiMarco Dated?</h2><p>Adam DiMarco has been working steadily since 2010 and, at the time of this writing, has 46 acting credits on his IMDb. But there's no doubt that his role in HBO's The White Lotus is his most high-profile. Therefore, only now are people paying attention to his personal life. Finding details about his past girlfriends on the internet is a little tricky. However, we do know that he was involved with Hannibal star Kacey Rohl for some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While DiMarco nor Rohl have spoken publicly about their relationship, there's enough photo proof on the internet to assume they were an item at one stage. However, they haven't been together for at least a few years.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to WhosDatedWho</a>, DiMarco was rumored to have been involved with his Order co-star, Sarah Grey. Despite the two clearly being close off-set, there's not enough information to confirm this romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>VergeWiki and various Adam DiMarco fan Tumblr accounts have pictures of the actor getting awfully close with a number of other women. It's clear a few of these images were once featured on his Instagram, but they've since been wiped clean.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Alexandra Daddario Knows Exactly What Happens To Rachel After The White Lotus</a></span></p><p>During an interview with What She Said in February 2021, Adam DiMarco admitted that he and actor Sydney Scotia started dating near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They had worked together on Recess: Third Street and clearly became close after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many couples, DiMarco and Scotia were brought closer by the pandemic and were even asked to play a couple in the Crave original series Pillow Talk. While DiMarco and Scotia dated for a period, it's very, very unlikely that they're still together. There's little to no other evidence of them being in each other's life and neither follows the other on Instagram; a sure-fire sign that things went sour.</p><p>As for his relationship status today, all signs point to Adam DiMarco being single.</p><h2 id=is-adam-dimarco-like-albie-on-the-white-lotus>Is Adam DiMarco Like Albie On The White Lotus?</h2><p>In his interview with GQ, Adam DiMarco claimed that he saw some aspects of himself in the character of Albie Di Grasso when he read the script. And clearly creator Mike White saw these connections too. According to DiMarco, White even thought he showed up to a meeting in character. In reality, he was just being himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"On a surface level, we’re both half-Italian. Our names are weirdly similar. He’s described as this sweet, nice boy," DiMarco explained of his connection with Albie to GQ. "And I’m Canadian, so we have a reputation for being 'nice.' I think we’re maybe less aggressive than other people."</p><p>Many of his fans are likely to wonder if Adam DiMarco shares some of Albie's "good guy" personality traits. Here's what he had to say about that...</p><p>"On a deeper level, I mean, who doesn’t like when things are peaceful?" DiMarco said. "That’s always been one of my goals in life, just finding peace. To say I want to be happy every day of my life is unrealistic. But you can find peace every day."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>White Lotus Star Haley Lu Richardson Has A Complicated Relationship With Her Looks</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some may find some of these traits undesirable, not unlike Haley Lu Richardson's Portia, The White Lotus almost certainly shows the pros and cons of Albie's soft side. DiMarco believes that Albie is almost certainly overcompensating for his father and grandfather's behavior toward women.</p><p>"He’s almost overcorrected things or tried to overcompensate in a certain direction. I think he sees his father [Michael Imperioli] and his grandfather [F. Murray Abraham] as the other side of a pendulum and he’s trying to swing it back in a big way," DiMarco admitted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It’s just made him extremely in his head and he overthinks a lot of things as a result. We’re all like our parents more than we realize, too, so I think he’s fighting against his nature in a way, which must cause some anxiety."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>White Lotus Creator Mike White Got Extremely Honest About Season One's Controversial Ending</a></span></p><p>While DiMarco believes that the fact that Albie is so nice can be a good thing, he also sees its negative side. During his interview with GQ, DiMarco was asked whether Albie is terrible in the love department or whether he's focused his attention on the wrong type. His answer may shed some light on how he actually deals with his own love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think both," Adam DiMarco said to GQ of Albie having 'little game' and going for the wrong person. "But he has some game. His game is just being the only option. Like Portia says, he just 'doesn’t get the heart rate up.' I think that’s because he’s so focused on himself and what he’s doing and that he’s not offending anyone, that he’s not really fully aware of what the other person might want at that moment. Portia just wants to be, as she says, thrown around by some hot Italian guy. And sometimes it’s okay to do that without tip-toeing around it first."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1drLWqwMRmo6ispah6tLHArKanZWJisKK%2F02aYnZmdYrGqucCrmqhlkaGvqrGMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZquklsG2v44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elizabeth-olsen-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elizabeth Olsen Children: Does Elizabeth Olsen Have Kids?">&larr;
