BUT we are ready to share our love with the world,” she wrote.</p><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>Hey guys!!! I’m so excited to finally introduce you to my beautiful girlfriend @scooler23 I’ve tried keeping her out of the spotlight for a year and a half for the most part to protect her, respect her, and take things slow. BUT we are ready to share our love with the world Stephanie is one of the kindest humans I’ve ever met. She is patient with me, understanding, kind, loving, caring, smart, beautiful, sweet, passionate, peaceful, goal oriented, PATIENT, patient and did I say patient? Lol she is everything I’ve ever wanted and dreamt of but didn’t know existed. She puts me first a lot and prioritizes my happiness without compromising hers. She supports me through everything. This is truly what love is and I’m so lucky to have found it. I love u Stephi and I can’t wait to spend my life with u. Everyone send my baby girl some love isn’t she so beautiful?!!!!! P.S. yes it’s weird my girlfriend and sister have the same name Thank you to @firethecanon for capturing this moment</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Natalie Mercedes Negrotti</a> (@natalienegrotti) on Apr 25, 2019 at 2:15pm PDT</p><p>The TV personality, who also added a link to Stephanie’s <a href=#>Instagram page</a> in her bio next to the words “My Bae,” went on to praise her partner for her attributes, calling her, “one of the kindest humans I’ve ever met. She is patient with me, understanding, kind, loving, caring, smart, beautiful, sweet, passionate, peaceful, goal oriented, PATIENT, patient and did I say patient? Lol she is everything I’ve ever wanted and dreamt of but didn’t know existed.[sic]She puts me first a lot and prioritizes my happiness without compromising hers. She supports me through everything. This is truly what love is and I’m so lucky to have found it. I love u Stephi and I can’t wait to spend my life with u.”</p><p>She concluded by acknowledging that it was “weird” that her girlfriend and her sister both share the same name and asking her fans to send her significant other good vibes. “Everyone send my baby girl some love isn’t she so beautiful?!!!!!” she gushed.</p><p>The Venezuelan-born star appears on Stephanie’s page as far back as June 2018, though the pair have been dating since January 2018.</p><p>Negrotti, who was eliminated from the current season of The Challenge in a March episode of the series, revealed to Us Weekly in February that she would soon be making the big announcement about her partner’s identity.</p><p>“<a href=#>I want to start showing my girlfriend</a> off a little bit. She’s so hot, so why not? It’s a waste,” she told Us.</p><p>She’s also extremely supportive of Negrotti. “She’s like, ‘Get in there. Do what you gotta do to win,'” the MTV star shared. “I feel like that’s why we’ve lasted so long, because I’m not really, like, a relationship kind of girl, so it was really nice to have someone that lets me be free!”</p><p>Negrotti revealed that she was <a href=#>pansexual and dating a woman</a> during a July 17 episode of The Challenge: Final Reckoning when she accused costar <strong>Kayleigh Morris</strong> of outing her by calling her a “lesbian” on social media.</p><p>The reality star, who had not yet come out to her family at the time, discussed the pain she felt during that moment during a “<a href=#>Watch With Us” podcast</a>.</p><p>“She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Negrotti explained. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay-shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘d-ke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”</p><p>Negrotti continued: “It’s been a 28-year battle for me … She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Ex on the Beach star, who also briefly dated <a href=#><strong>Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio</strong></a>, also <a href=#>opened up about her big moment</a> on <a href=#>Twitter</a> following the show. “Accepting myself as I was designed led me to the day I stopped trying to fit into a world that never really fit with me and gave me the chance to blossom into the person I am today #selflove,” she wrote.</p><p>She also shared her reason for coming out, tweeting, “<a href=#>I came out</a> with my story to share my truth with those who are battling the same thing I did. Do not throw hate at anyone for their actions. I wanted to use my platform to educate people who are not informed. Let’s spread love and education not hate.”</p><p>The Challenge: War of the Worlds airs on MTV Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVisKmty6Wcp5%2BVqHqvrdOao6KdXaOyqL7OrauiZZmjwbO7w66anqtdnLazuMWroJ6mlGLAtbHPoZinoZVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vanessa-hudgens-ilia-skin-tint-serum-amazon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Vanessa Hudgens-Approved Skin Tint Serum Is Only $48">&larr;
