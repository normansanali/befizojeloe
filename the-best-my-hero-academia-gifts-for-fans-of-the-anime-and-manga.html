Sometimes, villains can be even more interesting and complex characters than goody-two-shoes heroes, and Dabi is certainly one of them. So why not step out of the mold and go with an action figure of this fan-favorite antagonist?</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>This particular figure portrays Dabi using his fire Quirk in battle with a menacing smile, and it stands at around 5.12 inches. This collection also has other My Hero Academia villain figures available, like Shigaraki and Himiko Toga, to choose from. Depending on the figure, the size may vary, but they all come with a random trading card as a bonus.

These vinyl figures are a staple in every fan’s merchandise collection, being widespread in fandoms.

The set also includes two bonuses: a double-sided poster and a 48-page illustration book with commentary from the mangaka himself.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>If this person fell in love with the series only by watching the anime but has been wanting to dive into the manga, this is a perfect gift to give them a little push. On the other hand, if they have already read the manga online — but love a good collection — this box set would make their dream come true anyway. After all, nothing beats having the real thing in your hands and being able to proudly display your collection.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">My Hero Academia LED stand</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/todoroki-mha.jpg><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>In the modern world, everyone loves having LED lights in their homes.

With 15.6 inches in length, this plush can be used as the perfect pillow or just a source of comfort for anyone feeling down. According to reviews, its material is very soft and makes everyone want to squish it — not to mention how cute it is.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">U.A. High School Winter hat and scarf combo</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/hat-scarf-mha.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>For cold days, nothing is better than cozy items to keep us warm.

Not only would this make a cool gift but also a very useful one, especially for someone who doesn’t like the cold.</p><p data-characters=648 data-current-count=921 data-injectable=true>The items are in the U.A. uniform’s signature colors — green and gray — and feature the school’s sigil in white. For an extra touch, U.A.’s mottos, “Plus Ultra” and “Go Beyond” are also displayed in the scarf. Despite this, the design is neutral enough that it goes under the radar of anyone unfamiliar with the series, which can be ideal for more low-key fans. Both pieces are made of acrylic yarn material, and according to reviewers, it’s fairly soft to the touch. To make your life simpler, the items are designed to fit people of various sizes, so you don’t have to worry about measurements. This set is priced at $45.82.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My Hero Academia fleece throw blanket</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blanket.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>Continuing on the winter theme, another great option would be a fleece throw blanket.
