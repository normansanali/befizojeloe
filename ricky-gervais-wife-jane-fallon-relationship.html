A perfect example of that is that it seems like famous actors everywhere get worried every time Gervais hosts the Golden Globes.As a result of all the edgy jokes Gervais has told in the past, some people believe that he simply delights in being shocking. However, anyone who has followed Gervias' career clearly closely knows that he is perfectly capable of being sweet in the middle of all his edgy jokes.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ricky Gervais Regrets Nothing Except For Roasting This Actor At The Golden Globes</a></span>In his role as the co-creator of the UK version of <a href=#>The Office</a> and the show's main star, Gervais crafted an offensive lead character and a show with a lot of heart. With that in mind, it shouldn't surprise anyone that while Gervais certainly can be harsh, he has a very sweet side too.For anyone who wants to witness Gervais' sweet side, all they have to do is watch clips of him talking about his longtime love. More than that, anyone who learns about Gervais' relationship with the love of his life is likely to be inspired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-ricky-gervais-longtime-love-jane-fallon>Who Is Ricky Gervais' Longtime Love, Jane Fallon?</h2><p>According to reports, Ricky Gervais and the accomplished writer and producer Jane Fallon have been in a relationship since 1982.

However, the couple definitely is common law married and Gervais has described their relationship as akin to a marriage.</p><p>An outspoken atheist, as Gervais once explained, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he doesn't think there is any reason for him and Fallon to have a ceremony</a> based in religion,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We are married for all intents and purposes, everything's shared and actually our fake marriage has lasted longer than a real one. But there's no point in us having an actual ceremony before the eyes of God because there is no God."</p><p>On top of sharing her life with Gervais, Fallon has accomplished a lot in her career. Most notably, Fallon has produced shows like Eastenders, and she is a novelist who has written a long list of successful books.</p><h2 id=what-makes-ricky-gervais-and-jane-fallon-so-inspiring>What Makes Ricky Gervais And Jane Fallon So Inspiring?</h2><p>Since Ricky Gervais has been in the public eye for a long time now, he has been interviewed many, many times, to say the least. During most of those interviews, the questions focused on his latest project or his opinions on life and comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Ricky Gervais Gets Away With More Than Other Comedians</a></span></p><p>On the rare occasion when Gervais has been asked more personal questions, he has always seemed like an open book. Most notably, after people <a href=#>started to think Gervais was a softy</a> after the release of his show After Life, he was asked some questions about his love life.</p><p>During a 2022 appearance on the One Show, the subject of Gervais' longtime love Fallon came up. At that moment, Gervais said something unapologetically selfish that revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how deeply he loves Fallon and can't handle the idea of losing her</a>.</p><p>"I had to think, “What’s it like to lose everything?” And to me, it’s your soul mate, your life partner.

I don’t want to…"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone who dreams of finding love someday, the idea that Gervais loves Fallon so much that he would prefer to pass away earlier than be without her should be inspiring.</p><p>In 2017, Gervais was interviewed by People. During the resulting conversation, the rich and famous comedian spoke about the early times of his relationship with Jane Fallon.</p><p>As it turns out, when Gervais and Fallon were starting out, they went through some extremely lean times together. As a result, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gervais and Fallon shared a tiny apartment</a> that Ricky described vividly.</p><p>“I think it was above some sort of seedy sauna . . . That’s all we could afford. Our little bed was in this room. I could open the fridge from the bed.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> “It was a shared toilet with the other flats so if I needed a wee in the night, I just popped in the sink . It was closer. I remember once Jane, in her hazy state, just going, ‘Oh at least take the dishes out first.'”Sharing an apartment that small with anyone will sound like a nightmare to a lot of people. Despite that, Gervais and Fallon's relationship not only survived living in that apartment, but it also seemed to thrive.Even though movies and TV shows often portray an idyllic version of love, life is a lot harder than that. Fortunately, anyone who is afraid they won't find the kind of relationship that can overcome hard times only has to look at Gervais and Fallon as proof that it is possible. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopubrnqosdGvmKKrXay2p7GMo5innV2brq24zqdkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./stan-van-gundy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stan Van Gundy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;
