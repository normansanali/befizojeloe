From her Wikipedia page, family details, and funeral arrangements, many are searching about her marital life.</p><p>Among them, one of the most searched topics is Takarra Farrington Baby In Casket. The title alone raises multiple questions; did something happen to Takarra’s baby; is the little one also no more; what is the baby in the casket all about?</p><p>While the questions are many, the answers are either limited or none. First and foremost, there is no mention of Takarra Farrington’s baby being in critical condition or any unfortunate updates about the little one’s health.</p><p>Takarra shared a son Ayden Jones with her hubby, Colin Jones. The little one and the rest of the Jones family are staying away from the limelight.</p><p>This is totally understandable, as the family is going through a period of grief.

It has not been confirmed by Farrington’s family or loved ones.</p><p>Unless and until information comes from authentic sources such as family, we urge readers not to follow any news regarding Takarra Farrington’s Baby In Casket.</p><p>Talking about Farrington-Jones’ funeral, it took place on April 9 at 11 am in St. John’s Native Baptist Church. Officiated by Rev. Harrison Butler, the event was screened live by JS Event Management’s FB account.</p><p>The funeral service was attended by Takarra’s family, relatives, and loved ones, who gathered together to pay their final respects. The environment was melancholy, accompanied by somber music.</p><p>To conclude, Takarra Farrington was a beloved daughter, wife, mother, sister, friend, and relative.
