Just 65 seconds later, another call came in – this time from her husband, Nick Firkus, 27.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"My wife is shot, somebody broke into our house," Nick Firkus screamed into the phone. "I've been – shot."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c3f48892-26c5-4026-b3c6-11c8ff281350/rachel-firkus-deborah-roberts-abc-jef-230411_1681246908545_hpEmbed_16x9.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus had a gunshot wound to his thigh. Heidi Firkus had been shot in the upper back and was unresponsive.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Heidi Firkus died at the scene.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In a video interview obtained by "20/20," Nick Firkus told police a story of a burglary gone wrong.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus said that he awoke to a suspicious noise at his front door, grabbed his shotgun and alerted his sleeping wife.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus claimed the gun went off during a life-or-death battle with the burglar and the gun discharged twice- hitting Heidi Firkus, then himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b7b2c444-152e-430c-83f3-e7b1ffc17908/nick-heidi-firkus-ht-jef-230411_1681246908548_hpEmbed_2x3.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I don't remember exactly what happened, but the gun went off. So my fingers slipped down to the trigger -- went off," Nick Firkus told Sgt. Jim Gray of the St. Paul Police Department.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The Firkus house was clean and tidy, and the entryway table beside the front door was undisturbed.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Extensive neighborhood canvassing and a K9 search showed no sign of an intruder.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"He thought he was a Black male, but was not entirely sure," Sgt. Jim Gray told ABC News in an interview.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus told Gray that the couple was in financial trouble. They were in over $15,000 of credit card debt, and losing their home.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">None of their friends or family knew they were to be evicted the very next day. Investigators found no signs that the couple was packing up for a move.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It did not look like anybody was planning to go on a long vacation, let alone moving out of the house," Commander Jake Peterson said in an interview with ABC News.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In a review of correspondence between the couple and financial documents found in the home, investigators were unable to find any proof that Heidi Firkus knew of the impending eviction.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Finally, Gray asked the big question; "Did you have anything to do with [the murder]?"</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"No," Nick Firkus said. "Absolutely not."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9bf9d9d5-fa2e-4435-8bfe-c2e7d184ed15/nick-heidi-engagement-ht-jef-230411_1681246908547_hpEmbed_3x4.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus retained the services of a defense attorney, Joe Friedberg, who recommended he cease contact with the St. Paul Police Department.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">At the advice of his lawyer, Nick Firkus declined the SPPD's request to sit down with a police sketch artist to create a composite of the alleged intruder.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I knew they'd use that as a lever to try interrogating him more. So, I said, no, we won't do that, but we'll hire an artist and do it," Friedberg told ABC News.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus and Joe Friedberg returned to the SPPD with their own sketch of the alleged intruder who Nick said was a Black male, in his late 30's and wearing a hoodie.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The police released the sketch through the media to see if any tips would come in. Years later a woman identified Michael Pye to police as a potential match.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We started researching him immediately and we started to learn that he was engaged in a pattern of breaking into homes in St. Paul around six in the morning," Peterson said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">However, Pye was incarcerated on the day of Heidi Firkus' murder. Authorities subsequently cleared him of having any involvement in Heidi's death.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A few months after Heidi Firkus' death, Nick Firkus met Rachel Watson.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I definitely felt sorry for him that he had gone through such a trauma," Rachel said in an interview with ABC News.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">After a year of dating, in August of 2012, Rachel and Nick were married.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The couple went on to have three children and moved into a house purchased for them by Nick Firkus's parents.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick and Rachel had an arrangement where they would pay the mortgage amount to Nick's parents and Nick Firkus would pay the property taxes directly to the county.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Rachel Firkus found a notice in their home that stated that they were delinquent on their property taxes, and that their house was in danger of being foreclosed on.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Rachel Firkus said her mind immediately went to Heidi Firkus's death.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I didn't know that this was happening and I'm living with this person. I have children with this person, and the last time he had problems with finances, a lot of things went wrong," she said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Rachel Firkus decided to confront Nick Firkus and recorded the conversations, which have been exclusively obtained by ABC News.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In one recording Rachel Firkus said, "the fact that your lying was so easy for you to do in front of me over and over and over makes me think..."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"That I could murder my wife?" he responded. She replied, "Yes."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The couple divorced in 2018.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In 2019, Sgt. Nichole Sipes of the St. Paul Police Department took a new look at the death of Heidi Frikus.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The case always bothered me because the circumstances didn't seem to fit what happened," Sipes told "20/20."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Sipes reached out to the FBI to help reconstruct sound data from the 911 call to see if there was evidence of a third person in the house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d3246266-9d6e-401e-9d12-9294db609278/rachel-firkus-abc-jef-230411_1681246856132_hpMain_16x9t.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"There was no noise that we could detect in the background," said FBI Agent Pat Reilly.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The FBI also combined their ballistics testing and a virtual model of Heidi and Nick Firkus' house to prove that the shots were most likely not "accidental" in the middle of a struggle – but deliberate.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">However, Nick's attorneys countered that these findings didn't necessarily disprove his version of the events.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Once Sipes learned of Nick Firkus' recent divorce from his second wife, she reached out to Rachel Firkus, who shared her suspicions.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"She could have also been a victim," Sipes said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In May 2021, Nick Firkus was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the death of his former wife. A grand jury later indicted him for first-degree murder.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Ramsey County prosecutors argued that Nick Firkus hid details of their financial troubles from his wife, and murdered her due to the shame of their impending eviction.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It wasn't just going to be the loss of this house, it was going to be the realization that he had lied to his wife, and he had lied to his friends, he had lied to the community for many years," Ramsey County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lamin told "20/20."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Robert Richman, Nick Firkus' defense attorney, refuted these allegations.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In addition to the financial evidence, prosecutors also found only Nick Firkus's DNA on the gun, and several witnesses testified there were no signs of a break-in.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Nick Firkus's attorneys claimed the intruder was wearing gloves and only in the home for a couple of seconds so he couldn't leave DNA evidence.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">On Feb. 10, after four hours of deliberations, the jury found Nick Firkus guilty of murder. He was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">His family declined a request from ABC News for an interview but issued a statement in support of him.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">"He was wrongfully convicted and sits in jail for a crime he did not commit. This is not just the belief of heartbroken parents," the statement read in part.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunChsmhpp5xdrLansdJmqq6roJ6wqrvNrGScp56btrO5xJ1koa2jl66vsNJmmKuqlajBbrnUq5ueql%2BowbC%2B2HignXVpbYF6hJBqaw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billy-jeffrey-net-worth-266663.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billy Jeffrey Net Worth 2024">&larr;
