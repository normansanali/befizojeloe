While <a href=#>some Disney stars have struggled to land other roles</a>, Jeffery seems to be doing just fine. In fact, the Vancouver native has branched out to other projects in recent years. Although, she also remains a Disney talent up to now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Descendants': Sofia Carson Originally Auditioned For This Role</a></span></p><p>At the moment, reports indicate that Jeffery has an estimated half a million net worth and fans have no doubt that this would grow steadily throughout her career. That’s because Jeffery has been hard at work in recent years.</p><h2 id=unbeknownst-to-many-she-didn-t-start-out-at-disney>Unbeknownst To Many, She Didn’t Start Out At Disney</h2><p>Sure, Disney may be known for discovering fresh talent and catapulting them to fame. However, when Disney Channel happened upon Jeffery, she wasn’t exactly new to the business. In fact, she had already starred in a little-known 2013 film (Aliens in the House) before joining the cast of the sci-fi mystery series Wayward Pines. Here, she worked alongside a cast of seasoned actors such as Carla Gugino, Melissa Leo, Matt Dillon, Toby Jones, and Siobhan Fallon Hogan. Of the experience, Jeffery told Showbiz Junkies, “Getting to work with that class of actors at a younger age was amazing. I was very grateful.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeffery only ended up appearing on Wayward Pines for six episodes. Soon after, she joined Disney’s Descendants franchise. In Descendants, Jeffery plays the antagonist Princess Audrey, a character that is a stark contrast from Jeffery herself. “I’ve always been mindful about leading with kindness and generosity,” she explained during an interview with Imagista. “And Audrey tends to be a bit self-centered and sassy.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Do The Stars Of ‘Charmed’ Feel About The Reboot?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, Jeffery wasn’t able to reprise her role in the second Descendants film (she managed to return for the third one though). That’s because the actress booked another gig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-soon-found-herself-working-with-jennifer-lopez>She Soon Found Herself Working With Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>Whereas most Disney stars end up doing other shows for the network Jeffery found herself switching gears after she got cast in the NBC cop drama Shades of Blue. The series centers around a New York detective played by <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>. Meanwhile, Jeffery played Lopez’s daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While working on the show, Jeffery had to juggle several projects at the same time. Fortunately, she had a great role model on the set. “People like Jennifer Lopez who are so busy – I don’t know how she does it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffery told Starry Mag</a>. “Looking at my plate is kind of a reminder that I don’t have so much. She is very inspiring!”</p><h2 id=she-eventually-joined-the-charmed-reboot>She Eventually Joined The Charmed Reboot</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When news broke that there were plans for a Charmed reboot (an idea that several former stars never approved of), Jeffery auditioned for a part as soon as she could. Unfortunately, studio execs didn’t think it was a good idea to cast her initially since she had other work commitments. “They at first didn’t really want to see me because I was attached to another show. I was attached to Shades of Blue and we just finished our last season,” the actress recalled. “They were like, ‘We don’t want to see her and like her and then have to battle for first position.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How 'Charmed' Star Holly Marie Combs Got A Scar On Her Eyebrow</a></span></p><p>In a sudden twist of fate, however, everything just worked out. “They did see me and they did want me and it just ended up falling into place. Shades moved to second position and Charmed had me for first,” Jeffery explained. “Shades ended up getting canceled after the third season anyway, so it just all worked out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite controversies surrounding the show, things have been going well for Jeffery and the rest of the cast. “We get along so well. Automatically, we were just connected,” the actress explained. “We watch Charmed clips together. It’s great. I think we’re very lucky. It was just like a natural connection.” Earlier this year, the CW granted Charmed an early renewal for a fourth season.</p><h2 id=she-looks-to-pursue-more-music-in-the-future>She Looks To Pursue More Music In The Future</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Jeffery, working with Disney didn’t just allow her to land another acting gig, it opened up the possibility of pursuing a music career too (just like Justin Timberlake, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, Demi Lovato, and Christina Aguilera did). It all started when she was asked to sing the song Queen of Mean for the Descendants franchise. “When I heard it for the first time, I got emotional,” Jeffery recalled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while speaking with Billboard</a>. “I feel like people can relate to it because it's this song about never being seen and being forgotten about, and wanting to change that.”</p><p>The success of the track also inspired Jeffery to do more music work soon. “Music has always been something that I knew that I would eventually want to pursue,” the actress explained. “I've been really busy with things on the acting side, so [music] hit the backburner for a minute, but I feel like this is a perfect segue into doing my own music.” Jeffery has also since recorded the song Even the Stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeffery is set to star in the upcoming Disney animated special Descendants: The Royal Wedding. The actress hinted she gets to “come into a large role” this time around.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Dove Cameron And Other ‘Descendants’ Cast Members Pay Tribute To Cameron Boyce On His Birthday</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqqRnXqrscWfnKuxXaK8t7XErGSappRiwbd50qGmsKtdo7K1edaoqa2gXZius7HEq2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jane-fonda-throws-award-at-justine-triet-at-2023-cannes-film-festival.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jane Fonda throws award at director Justine Triet at 2023 Cannes Film Festival">&larr;
