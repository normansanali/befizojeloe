Instead, most recently there has been a lot of attention paid to <a href=#>the celebrities who once appeared on Deal or No Deal</a> including <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> who held a briefcase.Of course, there were a lot of reasons why Deal or No Deal was such a big hit including how fun it was to see how lucky or unlucky contestants would be. It could also be argued that Howie Mandel hosting Deal or No Deal played a pivotal role in the show's success.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Anya Monzikova's Life Is Drastically Different Compared To Her Deal Or No Deal Days</a></span>Since Mandel was so important to the show's success, many fans were very disappointed when it was announced Howie was leaving the show. Even though it has been more than a decade since Mandel first left Deal or No Deal, many fans still wonder how much money he missed out on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-howie-mandel-lose-because-he-quit-deal-or-no-deal>How Much Money Did Howie Mandel Lose Because He Quit Deal Or No Deal?</h2><p>On the surface level, it may seem like it would be easy to figure out how much money Howie Mandel missed out on after quitting Deal or No Deal. In reality, however, things are rarely that simple and in this case, there are many things to consider.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Creep Vibes Prevail As Howie Mandel Teaches Fans To Laugh Without Smiling</a></span></p><p>The first thing to figure out is how much money Mandel was making as the host of Deal or No Deal. According to a cheatsheet.com report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mandel was being paid $75,000 for each episode</a> of Deal or No Deal he hosted by the time the show ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cheatsheet.com article that includes that figure cites a Forbes report that revealed that number as Mandel's Deal or No Deal salary. While Forbes is widely considered an extremely credible source, it is important to note that the Forbes article that cheatsheet.com linked to seems to be gone.</p><p>Considering there isn't a link to an active Forbes article, it makes sense to take the $75,000 figure with a grain of salt. On the other hand, the article that cheatsheet.com linked to existed at one point so it makes sense to assume that figure is at least close to accurate.</p><p>As is the case with many game shows, seasons of Deal or No Deal featured a lot of episodes. If each season of Deal or No Deal lasted 70 episodes and Mandel was paid $75,000, that means Howie would have made $5.25 million per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Mandel continued to host Deal or No Deal to this day, he would have hosted an additional 12 seasons since the show ended in 2009 and he returned for a single season in 2018. If Mandel hosted 12 more seasons of 70 episodes at $75,000 per episode, he would have made an additional $63 million.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-howie-mandel-make-on-america-s-got-talent>How Much Does Howie Mandel Make On America's Got Talent?</h2><p>While it is staggering to think that Howie Mandel theoretically could have lost out on more than $60 million, there is more to consider. After all, if Mandel was still hosting Deal or No Deal, he wouldn't have had the time to be a judge on America's Got Talent which he has done since 2010.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Facts About America's Got Talent That Fans Would Be Surprised To Learn</a></span></p><p>According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mandel is paid $70,000 for each episode of America's Got Talent</a> he stars in. Considering that IMDb credits Mandel with appearing in 335 episodes of AGT as of this writing, it should go without saying that adds up quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Mandel has been paid 70,000 for all of his credited 335 AGT episodes, he has earned $23.45 million to date.</p><p>If you take the $63 million Mandel theoretically could have been paid for Deal or No Deal and subtract the $23.45 million he has reportedly been paid for AGT, he has lost roughly $40 million.</p><p>Before anyone takes that at face value, however, there is one more thing to consider, longevity.</p><p>As of this writing, America's Got Talent has aired 17 seasons. On the other hand, there have only been 5 seasons of Deal or No Deal to date and there is a good reason for that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if Howie Mandel never quit Deal or No Deal, it seems extremely likely that the show wouldn't be on the air today. After all, no matter how much people liked that show, the truth is that it was a repetitive show.</p><p>Does anyone think that people would habitually tune in to see people guess which briefcases to open for 17 years? After all, when Deal or No Deal was brought back in 2018, it went away after only one season.</p><p>Even if Mandel hosted another five seasons of Deal or No Deal that lasted 70 episodes, he would have been paid $26.25 million. With that in mind and the fact that America's Got Talent is likely to last for years to come, Mandel's decision to leave Deal or No Deal very likely netted him money overall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter how you look at the situation, things clearly have worked out great for Mandel. After all, <a href=#>Mandel has a $60 million fortune</a> as of this writing according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doq6vsMSlZKedpGLEsL7ToWSanqSav2691KKrraGenHqlscClZKiqXaO8brDEmqNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-bo-bichette-married-what-to-know-about-blue-jays-star-girlfriend-and-dating-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Bo Bichette Married?
