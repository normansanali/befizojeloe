Gen. John Lubas, deputy commander of the 101st Airborne Division.</p><p>No other civilian casualties or injuries were reported as both Black Hawks crash-landed in an open field.</p><p>Additionally, the crashed helicopters were just two of four in the exercise on Wednesday night, 101st Airborne Division spokesman Staff Sgt. Joshua Tverberg told <a href=# aria-label="CNN (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>.</p><p>Tverberg explained that one of the other helicopters had landed to refuel while the other was flying ahead of the two that crashed.</p><h2>'TWO BOOMS'</h2><p>An eyewitness to the crash told&nbsp;<a href=#>WKDZ</a>&nbsp;that they heard "a pop" and "two booms" from their home, located just a half mile away from the crash site.</p><p>There was reportedly little wind in the area at the time of the crash.</p><p>The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.</p><p>An investigation will seemingly ensue after a separate military team arrives from Fort Rucker in <a href=#>Alabama</a>, according to Lubas.</p><p>The names of those that died in the crash, aside from Caleb, will be released periodically as Lubas intends to notify the soldiers' <a href=#>families</a> first.</p><p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said the community would come together to support each other after the crash.</p><p>"We’re going to do what we always do, we’re going to wrap our arms around these families, and we’re going to be there with them, not just for the days but the weeks and months and years to come," Beshear said in a news conference.</p><p>Army Secretary Christine Wormuth also said it has been "a heavy day for the Army" during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday.</p><p>"Thank you for your comments and thoughts and prayers for the families of our soldiers who were killed in the crash. Our hearts go out to them,” Wormuth added.</p><p>This helicopter incident comes just over a month after a&nbsp;UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter <a href=#>slammed onto a highway</a> in Alabama, killing two National Guardsmen.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Tennessee</a>&nbsp;National Guard was responsible for the aircraft and was running a training flight near Burwell Road in Huntsville,&nbsp;Alabama&nbsp;when the crash happened.</p><p>Soldiers Daniel Wadham and Danny Randolph were killed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For more on the military, check out The U.S. Sun's coverage of Major Scotty Mills, a man involved <a href=#>in the invasion of Iraq</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Sun also has the story on how the United States recently launched <a href=#>its "largest-ever show of force."</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/caleb-gore-familys-horror-heartbreaking-806644034.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdnbIJ4gJFqZqGdkafBo77EmqKippdisabAwKKjrGWTlrmmroygpqudXay2p7GMqamen56Wu7V7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-replace-a-two-handle-shower-valve-with-a-single-handle-unit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Replace a Two-Handle Shower Valve With a Single-Handle Unit (DIY)">&larr;
