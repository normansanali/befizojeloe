During his professional basketball career, he first ran with the Boston Celtics starting in 1999. He would go on to play with other teams including the Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, and the Chicago Bulls on multiple occasions. After retiring from the court, Adrian transitioned to a coaching career where he would again join up with multiple teams.</p><p>Between 2023 and 2024, he served as the head coach for the <a href=#>Milwaukee Bucks</a>, having previously worked with them as an assistant coach during his early years of coaching. However, he was fired from his position after less than a year on Jan. 23, 2024, amid a 30-13 season with the Bucks.</p><p>With Adrian's future career prospects uncertain, many fans have become curious about his current net worth following his removal.

His first stint as head coach only came on June 5, 2023, when he was tapped to lead the Milwaukee Bucks in the upcoming season at the time. Despite having garnered some success as an assistant coach with the Raptors in 2019, this seemingly did not translate to his head coaching.</p><p>In terms of his net worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a> reports that he is currently worth approximately $5 million as of 2023. His salary during his time with the Bucks was also reportedly $4 million, though there isn't an official confirmation on this claim.</p><p class="sc-ljslrt jczKas"><span>Adrian Griffin</span></p><p class="sc-htmbXw iarkkR">NBA coach</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $5 million</p><p>Adrian Griffin is a basketball coach in the NBA.
