A longtime star on Bravo’s <strong><a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a></strong>, the <strong>former Housewife made disparaging claims against Cohen</strong>, which other Bravolebrities later reiterated. However, <strong>the investigation’s outcome did not deliver justice for Glanville.</strong> Instead, it found Cohen innocent of her claims.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Glanville has gone against the grain and made outlandish comments or accusations against those at NBC and Bravo. In fact, she’s made an entire career out of it. Below we’re going to take a closer look at <strong>Brandi Glanville’s response to the investigation</strong>, what Andy Cohen was being accused of, and Glanville’s long, complicated history with Bravo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brandi-glanville-slammed-the-outcome-of-andy-cohen-rsquo-s-investigation>Brandi Glanville Slammed The Outcome Of Andy Cohen’s Investigation</h2><p>In May 2024, investigations found Brandi Glanville’s <a href=#>accusations against host and producer, Andy Cohen</a>, unfounded. According to Rolling Stone, a representative for Bravo write, "“The outside investigation into the recent allegations made by Brandi Glanville and Leah McSweeney against Andy Cohen has now been completed, and the claims were found to be unsubstantiated."</p><p>Bravo fans quickly began chatting about the situation on social media, many with negative things to say about Glanville. The former model took to X (formerly Twitter) to clap back at naysayers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brandi-glanville-in-a-blackdress-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>“I honestly am in shock that people don’t do their homework.

Glanville and her attorneys sent a letter to Bravo's parent company (NBC) threatening to sue.<strong> The star accused Cohen of sexual harassment</strong> after he FaceTimed her about sleeping with another Bravo reality TV star and asked Glanville to watch. With Cohen being Glanville's boss at the time, she felt "trapped and disgusted." Cohen later made a public apology to Glanville and explained that he was merely "joking."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was absolutely meant in jest, and Brandi’s response clearly communicated she was in on the joke.

All About the Real Housewives shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glanville took to X again to talk about Cohen's alleged drug abuse</a> with an hour-long video. Cohen's lawyers shared that <strong>Glanville's accusations were "baseless."</strong> What followed was another former Housewife, <a href=#>Leah McSweeney, making similar accusations against Cohen</a>. Glanville welcomed the similar sentiment. With heavy claims against Cohen, multiple Bravolebrities showed their public support for him on social media; sharing that Cohen has always been professional and empathetic.</p><p>As of this article's publishing, <strong>it's unknown if Glanville will go through with a lawsuit</strong> and what she would be suing for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brandi-glanville-has-a-complicated-future-and-past-with-bravo>Brandi Glanville Has A Complicated Future And Past With Bravo</h2><p>Brandi Glanville has a complicated past and present with Bravo. After starring on The Real Housewives for multiple seasons, Glanville phased out of the series and wrote a successful line of books and a podcast. Ever the outspoken one, Glanville has had her fair share of issues with the network and its stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brandi-glanville-before-doing-nicole-lapin-s-podcast.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Year</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Brandi's Issues WIth Bravo</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>According to ScreenRant, in season 3 of RHOBH, Glanville was in hot water for revealing very sensitive information about fellow castmates, Adrienne Maloof and Paul Nassif. In a dramatic episode, Glanville shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maloof lied about her pregnancy</a> with her twins, and had a surrogate the entire time. Maloof and Nassif were devastated that Glanville shared something so private and threatened to sue.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>Glanville was an important part of The Real Housewives spin-off Vanderpump Rules. One of the show’s stars, Sheana Shay, was Glanville’s ex-husband’s mistress. Her ex’s galvanizing ways led to divorce and made her resentful of Shay, the spin-off, and created ongoing digs in the media.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p>According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glanville was sued for defamation</a> from another former Real Housewife, Joanna Krupa, after Glanville made vile assumptions about Krupa's body. The case was settled two years later, with Glanville having to pay Krupa $500,000.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2023</p></td><td><p>After appearing on the spin-off The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip,<strong> Glanville was accused of sexual assault </strong>by former Real Housewives of New Jersey star<strong> </strong>Caroline Manzo, as reported by Deadline. Glanville has denied the allegations but Manzo filed a lawsuit against Bravo. The allegations were so damning that the network won't release the footage of the season they filmed.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Brandi Glanville has a complicated past with Bravo, it's the network that made her a star. Saying outlandish things and never shying away from the truth is part of Glanville's persona. And while she's been a part of multiple Bravo projects, it's unlikely she'll return to the network — especially after her claims against Andy Cohen.</p><p>Whether Glanville files a lawsuit against Cohen or the network is unknown, but if there's one thing fans can expect from Glanville, it's to expect the shockingly unexpected.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5membZus8uapa%2BhnKGybq3NnbBmm5%2Bdsq95yKetnquknrSiwMiopWaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./arkham-asylum-burns-to-the-ground-in-new-joker-2-set-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arkham Asylum burns to the ground in new Joker 2 set video">&larr;
