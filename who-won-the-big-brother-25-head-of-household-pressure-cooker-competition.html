Prior to beginning the challenge, host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Chen Moonves</a> read out the rules to the houseguests (as well as those who were watching the Aug. 24 episode of the beloved series), which were slightly different from the first time the pressure cooker competition was played:</p><p>“There is no sitting, no kneeling, but squatting is okay. You can only leave the box after three people release their buttons. Also, there are no bathroom breaks. When you let go, you must claim a card from the wall. The cards contain something good or bad.”</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>With an unfortunate scary-verse twist, the houseguests had to complete the competition in the dark as well, with a pit of snakes in the middle — how spooky is that?</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>The pressure cooker competition is a legendary Big Brother challenge not just for its length, but also for how the competition played out back in 2005.
