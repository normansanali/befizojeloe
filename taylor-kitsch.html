Kitsch will write, direct and star in the drama Pieces.</p><p>Kitsch purchased 3.64 acres of land on Lake Austin, Texas in 2012 and began building a house there in 2015. Kitsch currently resides in Austin.</p><p>In 2010, Kitsch starred in Steven Silver's The Bang Bang Club, an historical drama set in South Africa which documents the final bloody days of the apartheid. He had to lose 35 pounds in two months to play the role of photojournalist <a href=#>Kevin Carter</a>, alongside <a href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a> and Malin Åkerman. In November 2010, The Hollywood Reporter named Kitsch as one of the young male actors who are "pushing – or being pushed" into taking over Hollywood as the new "A-List". In the 2012 Disney film <a href=#>John Carter</a>, based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's fantasy novel A Princess of Mars, he played the title character, a Confederate soldier who is transported to Mars. Despite the film's failure at the box office, Kitsch said, "I'm very proud of <a href=#>John Carter</a>. Box office doesn't validate me as a person, or as an actor."

HitFix's film critic Drew McWeeny wrote positively of Kitsch's bond with Johnson which he described as "not only credible but lived in and authentic throughout the film". McWeeny wrote that Kitsch was used the right way in this film with an ensemble cast that pushed him or challenged him in scenes which resulted in his playing them with appropriate intensity.</p><p>In 2006, Kitsch was cast in his breakout role on the NBC sports teen drama television series Friday Night Lights, based on Peter Berg's 2004 film of the same name and set in the fictional town of Dillon, Texas. For five seasons, Kitsch portrayed the role of Tim Riggins, a high school student who is the fullback/running back of the Dillon Panthers. The series premiered in October 2006 to universal critical acclaim from critics and over 7.7 million viewers. Kitsch has ruled out reprising his role in a potential film sequel to the television series. He played Pogue Parry in The Covenant, alongside <a href=#>Steven Strait</a>, <a href=#>Sebastian Stan</a>, <a href=#>Laura Ramsey</a>, <a href=#>Toby Hemingway</a>, <a href=#>Jessica Lucas</a> and <a href=#>Chace Crawford</a>. In February 2008, he signed on to play Gambit in the X-Men franchise spinoff X-Men Origins: Wolverine, released in May 2009. Of the fan-favorite character Gambit, Kitsch states, "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed to that. I love the character, I love the powers, and I love what they did with him. I didn't know that much, but in my experience, it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him. I'm excited for it, to say the least."</p><p>Kitsch was born in Kelowna, British Columbia. His mother, Susan (Green), worked for the BC Liquor Board, while his father, Drew Kitsch, worked in construction.

For a time in New York he was homeless and took to sleeping on subway trains in the middle of the night. In 2004, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he modeled for Diesel and Abercrombie & Fitch.
