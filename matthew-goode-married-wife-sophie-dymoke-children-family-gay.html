They are still seen together on red carpets at several events and, as the entertainment world waited to hear the news of their marriage, Matthew Goode said in an interview that he was already married.&nbsp;Details of where and when this happened (or if it ever happened) are not known and the fact that there is no ringing on Sophie’s fingers calls for more questions. so many answers.&nbsp;So we are still wondering if the marriage story is true or if it is about staying together for so long as you now feel married?</p><h2><strong><span>Who is Sophie Dymoke?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sophie Dymoke has been thrust into the spotlight since her relationship with Matthew Goode went public.&nbsp;As well as being known as the wife (or partner) of English actor Matthew Goode, Sophie is also a fashion designer and has worked for major fashion brands including VINCE, where she held the position of Director of Sales.&nbsp;She currently holds the same position (Sales Manager) at MiH Jeans.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Matthew Goode gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>There is really and absolutely no reason for this question as Matthew Goode is currently living with his sweetheart, Sophie Dymoke, with whom he has fathered three beautiful children.&nbsp;If he’s bisexual, we don’t see it yet, but at the moment he identifies as straight, even though he has portrayed gay characters in the movies.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Quick Facts – Height, Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>first name</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Matthew William Goode</span></p><p><strong><span>Known As</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Matthew Goode</span></p><p><strong><span>Occupation</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Actor</span></p><p><strong><span>Date of birth</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: April 3, 1978</span></p><p><strong><span>Horoscope</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Aries</span></p><p><strong><span>Place of birth</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Exeter, Devon, England</span></p><p><strong><span>Nationality</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: English</span></p><p><strong><span>Husband</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Sophie Dymoke</span></p><p><strong><span>Children</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: 3 (Matilda Eve, Teddie Eleanor Rose and Ralph Goode)</span></p><p><strong><span>Height</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: 6ft 2in</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: 81kg</span></p><p><strong><span>Eye color</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Blue</span></p><p><strong><span>Hair color</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: Light brown</span></p><p><strong><span>Net worth</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: $3 million</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGilkanBqbHWZp6op5Saeq6t0augnpxdrLansYyspqmgmZp6pcXMqKKeZZOdtq2w0Z6lZp6RoratxYygmLJn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-homecoming-netflix-deal-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Netflix Got Beyoncs Homecoming by Paying So Much Money">&larr;
