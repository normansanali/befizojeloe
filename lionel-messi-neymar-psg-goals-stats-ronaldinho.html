"He is a bit like me. He had some difficulties in getting used to his new environment at first, but I knew that he was going to succeed."</p><h3>Lionel Messi</h3><p>When you’re getting plaudits from arguably the greatest player that ever lived, then you know you must have done something right.</p><p>“I think that with his quality and fitness, Neymar will become the best in the world," Messi once said of his former Barca pal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000201590928-e1562663877901.jpg><h3>Ronaldinho</h3><p>This legend was in no doubt that his compatriot was his 'heir' at both Barcelona and Brazil.</p><p>“Without doubt, Neymar is already my heir," Ronaldinho said. "He is performing in that role and he has been for many years. He is a great player and he will be the face of Brazil for plenty of seasons to come.</p><p>"Neymar is a phenomenon. It’s nice to see a Brazilian continuing to make history and I think he can be the greatest in the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000004551727.jpg><h3>Xavi Hernandez</h3><p>The Barcelona legend and current Al Sadd boss praised Neymar for his knack of rising to the big occasion and playing with a smile on his face.</p><p>“He hasn’t just shown his quality but he has shown it in the big games like against Real Madrid – and that is where the big players really prove themselves," the Camp Nou icon said.</p><p>"I think any questions that were asked of Neymar have been very clearly answered. There were many people asking how he would adapt to European football – but I think we have seen very clearly how he has adapted. He is a great player, has a very good attitude, and will go on to be the best player in the world.</p><p>"Neymar’s happiness blows me away. The guy plays without any pressure.”</p><h3>Diego Maradona</h3><p>Another one of the game's greatest ever players said Neymar has similarities to Messi in his play.</p><p>“He is ready to deal with Messi and Cristiano. For me he should’ve been among the nominees for FIFA The Best award. Neymar is doing things in Barcelona that remind me of the early Messi’s years," the World Cup winner said while the Brazilian was at the Camp Nou.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/05/GettyImages-85788553.jpg><h3>Cesc Fabregas</h3><p>The Arsenal and Chelsea playmaker believes Neymar has striking resemblances to Netherlands icon Johan Cruyff in the way he plays.</p><p>“Neymar reminds me of Cruyff," Fabregas said. "I could never see him play live, but Cruyff had an incredible change of pace, like him. He starts fast, slows suddenly and restarts with a lot of speed.”</p><h3>David Beckham</h3><p>Whilst many believe he can be overly-expressive on the pitch, Beckham was struck by Neymar's humility when he met him.</p><p>The former England captain said: “It’s been clear ever since he signed for Brazilian team Santos at 17 that Neymar is an outstanding talent, a once-in-a-generation type of footballer who has fans on their feet whenever he gets the ball.</p><p>"I’ve always been struck by his humility. He’s respectful and wants to learn, which he proved when he arrived at Barcelona in 2013 to play alongside some of the game’s biggest stars.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/GettyImages-166165199jpg-JS575677490.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifKe7zq2ZmqScZIR1gZZwcGikmaS7priMppysq5liu6bFzJqpZqijnHqou8ClqmarpJbBtHnRqKWapJSeu6m7jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lionel-messi-marries-childhood-sweetheart-in-lavish-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lionel Messi marries childhood sweetheart in lavish wedding">&larr;
