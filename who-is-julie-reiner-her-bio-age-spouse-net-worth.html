So, as a mixology expert she, together with Frankie, is judging the mixologists’ creations on the level of creativity, how well they stick to the challenge, and just how much their drink tastes good.</p><p>Simply, putting it, Drink Masters is a reality competition on Netflix, with 10 episodes, where a dozen bartenders and mixologists compete to create memorable and unique drinks. And Julie and Frankie are there to determine who takes home the grand prize of $100,000. Of course, you also need to know that comedian Tone Bell as the show’s host is also joining Julie on this journey.</p><p>Julie’s recipes, before making their way on Netflix, have been featured in The New York Times, New York Magazine, Food & Wine, Imbibe, The Wall Street Journal, Esquire, Playboy, Gourmet Magazine, Food Arts, Bon Appetit, GQ, Fortune, Wine Enthusiast, O Magazine, Crains, Time Out NY and Time Out London, The London Times & Wine & Spirits, as well as on several TV shows.</p><h3><strong>Julie Reiner’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>A protégé of legendary bartender Dale DeGroff, Julie Reiner has proposed financially, among other things, over years. So, until 2022, she was said to have an estimated $4 million net worth as of 2022.</p><p>Of course, she generated this amount of money in several ways including from the sales of her book, from her companies, Social Hour and Mixtress Consulting, and as the mixologist.</p><p>In detail, Julie is the co-owner of world-renowned cocktail bars, Clover Club, and Leyenda in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. She is the author of The Craft Cocktail Party: Delicious Drinks for Every Occasion and has been elevating the cocktail scene in New York City for more than 25 years.</p><p>In 2020, she and her long-time Clover Club partner, Tom Macy even launched their own line of ready-to-drink canned cocktails called Social Hour Cocktails.</p><p>So, like that, Julie has been a key player in the modern cocktail scene for well over a decade.</p><p>She began her bartending career in San Francisco in the 1990s. Then, eventually, she made her way to New York in 1998.</p><p>In the year of 2003, owing not only to her talent for drink-making but to her acute business savvy, Julie opened Flatiron Lounge. Set with a focus on the classics, Flatiron was arguably New York’s first high-volume craft cocktail bar. Robert Simonson in A Proper Drink, even tributed it to have brought mixology to the masses.</p><p>In the years since Julie has had a hand in opening a number of the city’s top bars.</p><h3><strong>How Tall Is Julie Reiner?</strong></h3><p>Beautiful and ageless appearing Julie Reiner stands below 5’8” in height.</p><h3><strong>Julie Reiner Age</strong></h3><p>Julie Reiner was reportedly born in 1972. So, given that it is true, she should have turned 50 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Julie Reiner Spouse</strong></h3><p>Julie Reiner has been married to her spouse, Susan Fedroff since 8 March 2002. So, on this day in 2022, they had been married for 20 years and together for 24 years. On this day last year, which also marked International women’s day, Julie had taken to write on Facebook that she can not wait to see what the next 20 years bring. In exactly her words, she was hoping for more sunsets.</p><p>So, Julie and Susan are one proud gay couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/who-is-julie-reiner-her-bio-age-spouse-net-worth-2022-1-300x241.jpg><p>About Susan, she is self-employed, and a product of NYU university. Back in the day, she also went to Franklin High School, Somerset New Jersey as well as Rutgers – New Brunswick.</p><p>On February 27th last year, i.e., Susan’s birthday, Julie took to her social media to address her as her much better half before adding that she can not wait to celebrate so many more birthdays with her, preferably in warmer, sunnier places.</p><p>Julie, other than being an out woman with a wife also is a mother. Yet, not much has been revealed about her kids.</p><h3><strong>Is Julie Reiner On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Julie Reiner could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@mixtressnyc</a> with 1,391 posts and 21.7K followers. She also generally shared glimpses of her life and all things cocktail on Twitter @mixtressnyc and ‘Julie Reiner’ Facebook.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Julie Reiner’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Julie Reiner’s birthday is on July 14th and that makes her a Cancer.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Julie Reiner From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As rich as her life is in Brooklyn, New York, Julie Reiner still misses Hawaii, especially Oahu. Because that is where she was born and bred. Also, that is from where she drew much of her inspiration, for utilizing the freshest fruits and premier quality spices and spirits available in her original cocktails.</p><p>Growing up, young Julie always wanted to be a bartender at a Daiquiri bar on the beach. It also helped her to be inspired by her mother.</p><p>Julie’s mom loves to entertain and so there was a revolving door of visitors flying in because it was Hawaii. As for Julie, she would always be picking mangoes in their backyard, making margaritas, and passing hors d’oeuvres at the parties. So, Julie got that bug early on and in the years to come, she evolved her mother’s lessons into a bartending style that helped launch the modern cocktail movement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecmuo6KdXaeyqrrEq2ShnaJir6q7jJqenmWjpby2v8RmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./horace-grant-a-legacy-worthy-of-the-nba-hall-of-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Horace Grant: A Legacy Worthy of the NBA Hall of Fame">&larr;
