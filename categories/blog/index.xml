The presence of a red light indicates that you are short on water. More water should be added. The colour green indicates that you have enough water to generate mist. Even if you have thoroughly cleaned the unit and have plenty of water available, the red light will illuminate.

When the humidifier runs out of water, the Power Indicator Light will turn red, and the mist production will be turned off completely.</description></item><item><title>Who is Ahaan Panday Dating Now</title><link>/who-is-ahaan-panday-dating.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/who-is-ahaan-panday-dating.html</guid><description>Ahaan Panday
