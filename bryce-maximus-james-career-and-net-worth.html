Along with numerous other honors, his father, also known as “King James,” is the NBA’s most valuable player. He has also won two gold medals at the Olympics.</strong></p><p>The second child in the family to be born before their parents’ wedding is the celebrity child. Bryce’s love for basketball developed as he got older, and he is now following in his father’s footsteps by entering the sports industry. Moving closer to his goal, he was offered a first-division basketball scholarship at Duquesne University.</p><h2><span id=How_old_is_Bryce_Maximus_James_the_son_of_LeBron_James>How old is Bryce Maximus James, the son of LeBron James?</span></h2><p>Since his birth in 2007, he has been 15 years old as of 2022. His name is Bryce Maximus James. On June 14, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the star child saw his father, NBA player LeBron James, and his wife, Savannah.</p><p>Bryce, who was born to parents of diverse racial backgrounds, is of mixed ethnicity and possesses American citizenship. Being the second of his parents’ children, he grew up alongside his siblings.</p><h2><span id=His_Elevation>His Elevation</span></h2><p>Bryce, who was born to athletes, has adopted his parents’ bodies in addition to their sporting traits. By 2022, the growing child will have reached a height of 6 feet 4 inches.</p><h2><span id=Maximus_Bryce_James_finished_his_middle_school_education>Maximus Bryce James finished his middle school education.</span></h2><p>The 15-year-old formerly attended Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio’s Old Trial School while residing in Akron. However, he was forced to transfer schools when he and his family later moved to a new home in Los Angeles.</p><p>He was consequently moved, along with his older brother Bronny, to Sierra Canyon School. Bryce also reportedly attended Crossroads School in Los Angeles once. He was a member of that school’s basketball team, though it is unclear if he attended.</p><h2><span id=There_Are_Brothers_and_Sisters_for_Bryce_James>There Are Brothers and Sisters for Bryce James</span></h2><p>The famous youngster is his parents’ second child, as was previously announced. Having said that, he has a younger sister and an older brother. His sister was born after his parents tied their knots, but he and his brother were born earlier.</p><p>Bronny James, the eldest child in James’ family, was born on October 6, 2004. He recently went to prom and is almost done with high school. Both of their sons have a passion for basketball and want to play like their father.</p><p>In a similar vein, Zhuri Nova Zames, the family’s youngest, was welcomed on October 22, 2014. She is eight years old and goes to the same school as their brothers, Sierra Canyon School. She does, however, enjoy modeling and associated activities, in contrast to her siblings.</p><h2><span id=The_Parents_of_Bryce_Maximus_James_Are_Very_Successful>The Parents of Bryce Maximus James Are Very Successful</span></h2><p>LeBron James, popularly known as “King James,” is a great NBA player whose name is known to many. In any case, Bryce is the younger child of the basketball player, and Savannah James is his long-term spouse.</p><p>One of the top players in the NBA is his father. In addition to winning two Olympic gold medals, LeBron has won four NBA titles, four MVP honors, four NBA Finals MVP honors, and three All-Star MVP honors. In a similar vein, he was named the NBA’s most valuable player four times and became the youngest player in NBA history to achieve 30,000 career points.</p><h2><span id=The_Parents_of_Bryce_Are_Together_Ever_since_high_school>The Parents of Bryce Are Together Ever since high school</span></h2><p>Savannah and LeBron have known one another since their adolescent years. While most people reunite after becoming well-known, Bryce’s parents have supported him through thick and thin since the beginning.</p><p>In 2002, the couple initially crossed paths while they were in high school. The husband was a year older than his wife and enrolled in the rival school. Savannah refused to give James her phone number when he asked for it from one of her friends. Instead, when she was bored and had nothing to do, she got his number and gave him a call later that day.</p><p>After a few weeks of acquaintance, the then-girlfriend and boyfriend eventually began dating. After a few years, on January 1, 2012, in Miami Beach, the NBA player made her a proposal. Savannah answered, “Yes,” and on September 14, 2013, the following year, the couple had their wedding procession.</p><p>Even at the age of seventeen, Bryce is aware of his goals in life. Like his father, he is doing everything he can to establish himself in the sports business. He has already been receiving offers from elite clubs like Duke and Kentucky as he pursues his passion.</p><h2><span id=Bryce_James8217_Instagram_tale>Bryce James’ Instagram tale</span></h2><p>Instagram story of Bryce James upon his acceptance onto a Division I basketball scholarship at Duquesne University</p><p>In actuality, the 15-year-old was offered the first Division I basketball scholarship at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On August 21, 2022, LeBron posted on Instagram to express his joy about the news, writing, “AYYYEEE!!!” GO MAXIMUS @_JUSUTBRYCE, please. On his Instagram account, Bryce himself posted, “Happy to receive my first D1 offer from Duquesne #godukes.”</p><p>Bryce had previously been a member of Sierra Canyon School’s JV basketball squad. Furthermore, the brothers participated in their first game as a team for the California Basketball Club. The NBA athlete was overcome with emotion when he saw his sons sharing the court.</p><h2><span id=Is_Bryce_Maximus_James_in_a_particular_grade>Is Bryce Maximus James in a particular grade?</span></h2><p>Bryce is presently enrolled in the ninth grade and has previously finished his middle school education. He is now too young to receive his basketball ranking, though, therefore it hasn’t been given to him. Nevertheless, he is a great player and will soon surpass his father as a superb basketball player.</p><p>King James is doing everything in his power to help his children succeed. He practices with his boys Bryne and Bronny so he can teach them all the hints and techniques. He posted a video of himself and his youngsters playing hoops in the Lakers gym. In the caption, he penned,</p><p>“There is no better feeling than being with the people I love and doing what I love!”</p><p>It appears that the James family is preparing to expand their legacy. The three-time parent was ecstatic as he observed his son’s advancement. In the video, they demonstrated their shooting, dribbling, and dunking prowess.</p><p>A month earlier, in July 2022, Bryne’s windmill dunk motion even went viral in the media. Following his father’s retirement, young King James is poised to advance in his NBA career.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_Bryne_Maximus_James8217s_Net_Worth>What Is Bryne Maximus James’s Net Worth?</span></h2><p>In the world of basketball, the budding player is already becoming well-known. In addition, he has been receiving offers from several clubs and profiting from them. Bryne James’s net worth as of 2022 is estimated to be between $1 and $2 million.</p><p>His father, on the other hand, has $1.2 billion in total assets and is a multibillionaire. LeBron James has proven his worth in the NBA by dedicating half of his life to the league. In addition, he earns money via his production firm, commercial ventures, and brand sponsorships.</p><p>On August 18, 2022, he also inked a new two-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. With a contract worth $97.1 million, he became the highest-paid NBA player in NBA history.</p><h2><span id=Bryce_Maximus_James_Is_He_Married>Bryce Maximus James: Is He Married?</span></h2><p>The youngster in ninth grade is still enrolled in school and is concentrating on his academics and career. In addition, Bryce and his family have not discussed the subject of his dating. He is therefore not dating anyone at this time and is single.</p><p>Nevertheless, we would like to view him as the ideal companion.</p><h2><span id=Bryce8217s_Accounts_on_Social_Media>Bryce’s Accounts on Social Media</span></h2><p>All of the children of the renowned NBA player LeBron James have been able to draw in the public. That being said, Bryce is not an outlier.</p><p>He goes by the handle _justbryce on Instagram and has one million followers. Despite having accounts on Facebook and Twitter, he does not use them frequently.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Son</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>What Race Is 69 Tekashi | Family And Net Worth</a></h3>Daniel Hernandez is also known professionally as Tekashi69 and 6IX9INE (meaning "six nine").
