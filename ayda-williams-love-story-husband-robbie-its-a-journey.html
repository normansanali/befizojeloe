"I feel grateful to know that the man I'm in love with there is still the man I'm married to today, but even better.

And I've always been really reassured by Rob's ability to crawl out of things; he will always fight.

As the mother to our children, I need to know that their father wants to be here and he's going to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>do everything in his power to be clean</a>.

Ayda hopes her mother Gwen and her 18-year-old dog Poupette, who featured in the couple’s wedding, will be there. “I do think with my mom’s health and if Poupette can hold on one more year, we will do a 15- year anniversary renewal,” she says. “There are a lot of relatives and people who need to stay alive, but yes, let’s do it!”</p><h2>Ayda's activewear</h2><p id=ekndHX-jw8x data-wc=40>As he heads into his landmark big birthday – Robbie turns 50 on February 13 – the former star has never looked better, recently <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>posing in just pants and socks</a> to promote his wife's athleisure range, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Ayda Activewear</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=epF3SMR1ZaT data-wc=66>"I had professional models and Rob was the only one I didn't have to goad into doing anything.
